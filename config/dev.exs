#
# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed

#
#     mix phx.gen.cert
#
# Run `mix help phx.gen.cert` for more information.

#       certfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned.pem"

# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.
